    	<h2 id="rule" class="subtitle">The rules</h2>
    		<p>The basic rule is identical to the other popular falling-piece type puzzle games, which means that pieces are disappeared when they form a group of more than 4 pieces and if the group consists entirely of the same piece type.<br>
            And your goal is to earn as much points as possible, it's also common to other puzzle games.<br>
    		In addition to that, in Yurupoyo it applies an original rule called "coupling" or maybe "pairing"(although either way is possible I prefer to coupling).<br>
    		Coupling happens when two groups of 3 diffrent pieces become neighbors and even though coupling earns you less points than the normal four-pieces pairs, it'll show you some eye-candies if you are familliar with "Yuruyuri".</p>
    		<p>The more words a sentence has, the more complicated it becomes, I guess, right? So I'll just show you a few pictures and they'll surely explain what coupling is.<br>
            Then look at Fig.1, and guess where a coupling happens.</p>
    		<figure class="coupling_img">
    			<img src="coupling1.png" alt="Pieces in coupling">
    			<figcaption style="text-align:center">Fig.1 Himawari and Sakurako are in coupling</figcaption>
    		</figure>
    		<p>Himawari(the blue pieces at middle-center) and Sakurako(the yellow pieces below them) form groups of three and are next to each other, they are in coupling.<br>
    		What about Fig.2?</p>
    		<figure class="coupling_img">
    			<img src="coupling2.png" alt="Pieces not in coupling 1">
    			<figcaption style="text-align:center">Fig.2 Tough 3-piece groups, not neighbors</figcaption>
    		</figure>
    		<p>In Fig.2 Yui(the black pieces at middle-upper) and Akari(the red pieces in lower-right corner) make groups of three pieces but they are NOT next to each other and therefore aren't in coupling.<br>
    	    And then let's stick to Fig.3!</p>
    		<figure class="coupling_img">
    			<img src="coupling3.png" alt="Pieces not in coupling 2">
    			<figcaption style="text-align: center">Fig.3 Different pieces are next to each other but only one group has 3 members</figcaption>
    		</figure>
    		<p>This time around Himawari, Sakurako and Chitose(the gray pieces in upper-right corner) are adjacent to each other but any of the two groups don't have both 3 members(one has 3 and the others 2)
            and again they are not in coupling.</p>

    	<h2 id="addition" class="subtitle">Appendices</h2>
    		<p>I recommend you play Yurupoyo on Safari, Chrome and Firefox because <br>
    		And eh... as you may know, IE(Internet Explorer) often becomes out of controll so I don't include it in my support list :(</p>
    		<p>And finally you can enjoy it even more with a font called "<a href="http://azukifont.com/">Uzura Font(うずらフォント)</a>" installed. Uzura font itself is for Japanese though :)</p>
